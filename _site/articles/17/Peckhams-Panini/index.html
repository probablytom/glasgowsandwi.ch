<p><span class="newthought">Peckhams lunchtime paninis</span>  are an interesting alternative to a chain meal deal at a competitive price, which opts for quality over quantity. </p>

<!--abstract-->

<p>Members of staff have noted in the past that they’re a particularly good choice, as these are put together same-day, in-house — this is in contrast, clearly, to Peckhams’ own meal deal, where the sandwiches are mass-produced elsewhere and trucked into the store. I agree, when it comes to the quality of the sandwich: they’re clearly incomparable. However, at £3.20 without a drink or sides,<label for="deal-details" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="deal-details" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Panini deal: £3.20 for a toasted sandwich. Meal deal: £2.99 for a sandwich, drink, and crisps or two pieces of fruit. </span> there’s a tradeoff between the quality of what you’re getting, and whether you’re still going to be hungry afterward.</p>

<p>Situation is, you <em>might</em> end up feeling peckish afterward. The offering can come on a fairly large bap or a regular-sized sub. If a subway without extra salads etc wouldn’t fill you, then it’s worth picking up a little extra something to tide you over to teatime. Fortunately, Peckhams provides quiches, Spanish omelettes, and cakes at their deli, or for an additional £1.70 they’ll provide rather tasty soup.</p>

<p>The soup offer makes this quite a compelling deal; it also pushes the price into the range of some pretty fierce competition, such as Kember and Jones at £4.95, which happens to be just two or three doors away.</p>
