        <title>Peckhams Lunchtime Paninis</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;Peckhams lunchtime paninis&lt;/span&gt;  are an interesting alternative to a chain meal deal at a competitive price, which opts for quality over quantity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--abstract--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of staff have noted in the past that they’re a particularly good choice, as these are put together same-day, in-house — this is in contrast, clearly, to Peckhams’ own meal deal, where the sandwiches are mass-produced elsewhere and trucked into the store. I agree, when it comes to the quality of the sandwich: they’re clearly incomparable. However, at £3.20 without a drink or sides,&lt;label for=&quot;deal-details&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;deal-details&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Panini deal: £3.20 for a toasted sandwich. Meal deal: £2.99 for a sandwich, drink, and crisps or two pieces of fruit. &lt;/span&gt; there’s a tradeoff between the quality of what you’re getting, and whether you’re still going to be hungry afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Situation is, you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; end up feeling peckish afterward. The offering can come on a fairly large bap or a regular-sized sub. If a subway without extra salads etc wouldn’t fill you, then it’s worth picking up a little extra something to tide you over to teatime. Fortunately, Peckhams provides quiches, Spanish omelettes, and cakes at their deli, or for an additional £1.70 they’ll provide rather tasty soup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soup offer makes this quite a compelling deal; it also pushes the price into the range of some pretty fierce competition, such as Kember and Jones at £4.95, which happens to be just two or three doors away.&lt;/p&gt;
