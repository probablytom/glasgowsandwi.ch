This is a blog about sandwiches in Glasgow.

It turns out that Glasgow has a pretty fantastic sandwich scene. I'm certain that that's really true of most cities. What's important is knowing *where* to look, and *what* to look for. 

This blog is a record of my exploration of the different sandwiches Glasgow has to offer, and what I come to appreciate in sandwiches over time{% sidenote "expensive food" "As well as a good excuse to buy expensive, delicious food..." %}!
